# Custom synth with superdough

This guide shows how to extend **superdough** with your own synthesiser. The example below registers a simple additive ``organ`` synth that mixes several sine oscillators.

```javascript
import { registerSynthSounds } from 'superdough';

registerSynthSounds(); // default synths

// register the organ instrument
```
import { registerSound } from 'superdough';

registerSound('organ', (start, params, onended) => {
  // custom implementation as shown in packages/superdough/synth.mjs
});
```

Once registered you can use it in patterns:

```javascript
note('c3 e3 g3').s('organ')
```

The implementation lives in `packages/superdough/synth.mjs` and is heavily commented for educational purposes.
