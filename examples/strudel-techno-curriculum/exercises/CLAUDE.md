# CLAUDE.md - Exercises Directory

## Exercise Development Framework

This directory contains hands-on exercises for students to practice techno production techniques in Strudel. Exercises progress from guided tutorials to open-ended challenges.

## Exercise Structure

### Basic Template
```javascript
// Exercise M.N: Title
// Module: M - Exercise: N
// Difficulty: Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced
// Time: Estimated completion time
// Prerequisites: What student should know

/*
GOAL: What student will achieve

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

REQUIREMENTS:
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Requirement 3

BONUS CHALLENGES:
- Extra challenge 1
- Extra challenge 2
*/

// STARTER CODE
const pattern = /* partial code */;

// YOUR CODE HERE
// ...

// VALIDATION
// The result should:
// - Sound like X
// - Include Y elements
// - Run at Z BPM
```

## Exercise Types

### 1. Completion Exercises
Student completes partial code:
```javascript
// Complete this kick pattern
const kick = sound("bd*4").gain(/* YOUR VALUE */);
const bass = note(/* YOUR PATTERN */).s("bass");

stack(kick, bass).cpm(/* YOUR BPM */);
```

### 2. Modification Exercises
Transform existing patterns:
```javascript
// Given pattern
const original = sound("bd*4").gain(0.9);

// Transform it to:
// - Add swing
// - Make it more complex
// - Add variation every 4 bars
const transformed = /* YOUR CODE */;
```

### 3. Creation Exercises
Build from specifications:
```javascript
// Create a pattern that:
// - Uses Euclidean rhythms
// - Has exactly 3 elements
// - Evolves over 16 bars
// - Sounds like Robert Hood

// YOUR CODE HERE
```

### 4. Debug Exercises
Fix broken patterns:
```javascript
// This pattern has 3 errors. Fix them.
stak(  // Error 1
  sound("bd*4").gain(1.5),  // Error 2
  note("c1*8").s("bass")  // Error 3
).cpm("130")  // Error 4
```

### 5. Analysis Exercises
Recreate by listening:
```javascript
// Listen to: reference_track.mp3
// Recreate the:
// - Kick pattern
// - Hi-hat rhythm
// - Bass movement

// YOUR RECREATION
```

## Assessment Rubrics

### Basic Rubric
```javascript
// Exercise Assessment
const rubric = {
  technical: {
    runsWithoutErrors: 10,
    correctSyntax: 10,
    efficientCode: 10
  },
  musical: {
    soundsGood: 20,
    appropriateTempo: 10,
    genreAuthentic: 20
  },
  creative: {
    originalApproach: 10,
    goesBeeyondRequirements: 10
  }
};
```

### Detailed Feedback Template
```javascript
/*
EXERCISE FEEDBACK

Technical: X/30
- âœ“ Code runs correctly
- âœ“ Good use of functions
- âš  Consider more efficient approach for...

Musical: X/50
- âœ“ Great groove feel
- âœ“ Appropriate sound selection
- âš  Bass could use more movement

Creative: X/20
- âœ“ Interesting variation technique
- ðŸ’¡ Try exploring...

Overall: X/100
Great work! Focus on...
*/
```

## Solution Guidelines

### Solution Format
```javascript
// SOLUTION: Exercise M.N
// Multiple approaches shown

// Approach 1: Minimal
const minimal = /* solution */;

// Approach 2: Standard
const standard = /* solution */;

// Approach 3: Advanced
const advanced = /* solution */;

// KEY CONCEPTS:
// - Concept 1 explanation
// - Concept 2 explanation
// - Common mistakes to avoid
```

### Solution Principles
1. Show multiple valid approaches
2. Explain the thinking process
3. Highlight key learning points
4. Include common pitfalls
5. Suggest further exploration

## Interactive Exercises

### Self-Checking Exercises
```javascript
// Exercise with built-in validation
const exercise = () => {
  const userPattern = /* user code */;
  
  // Automatic checks
  const checks = {
    hasFourKicks: userPattern.includes("*4"),
    correctTempo: userPattern.includes("130"),
    hasGain: userPattern.includes("gain")
  };
  
  console.log("Exercise validation:", checks);
};
```

### Progressive Hints
```javascript
// Hint system
const hints = [
  "Hint 1: Consider using Euclidean rhythms",
  "Hint 2: Try sound('hh').euclid(?, 16)",
  "Hint 3: euclid(11, 16) creates a driving pattern",
  "Solution: sound('hh*16').euclid(11, 16).gain(0.4)"
];

// Reveal hints progressively
```

## Remember

Great exercises:
1. **Challenge appropriately** - Not too easy, not too hard
2. **Teach by doing** - Hands-on learning
3. **Sound musical** - Results should be club-ready
