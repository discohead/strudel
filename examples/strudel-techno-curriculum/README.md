## Example Pattern

Here's a taste of what you'll be creating:

```javascript
// Hypnotic minimal techno pattern
stack(
  // Driving kick
  sound("bd*4").gain(0.9),
  
  // Euclidean hi-hats
  sound("hh*16").euclid(11, 16).gain(0.4),
  
  // Minimal bassline
  note("c1 ~ c1 c1 ~ c1 ~ c1")
    .s("saw")
    .lpf(400)
    .release(0.1)
    .gain(0.7),
    
  // Hypnotic hook
  note("<c4 eb4 g4>")
    .s("fm4")
    .sometimes(x => x.add(12))
    .release(0.1)
    .delay(0.3)
    .gain(0.5)
).cpm(130)
```
