## The Infinite Curriculum

The beauty of techno is its endless evolution. This curriculum mirrors that—never complete, always growing, forever pushing into new sonic territories while honoring its roots.

Each module is both a destination and a departure point. Master one, and three new paths appear. The journey never ends.

```javascript
// The curriculum itself is a pattern
const curriculum = note("learning")
  .slow(Infinity)
  .every(module, expand)
  .sometimes(revolutionize)
  .always(inspire)
  .cpm(130);
```

Keep learning. Keep coding. Keep the dancefloor moving.

The future of techno is written in code, one pattern at a time.
