# Composing Techno Music with Strudel: A Graduate-Level Masterclass

## Executive Summary

This curriculum provides a comprehensive path to mastering techno composition using Strudel's live coding environment. Over 10 progressive modules, students learn to create professional-quality hypnotic minimal techno in the style of Jeff Mills, Robert Hood, Surgeon, and Donato Dozzy. The course emphasizes practical application, with each module producing immediately usable patterns that build toward complete track construction and live performance.

## Course Overview

### Philosophy
This curriculum treats Strudel not just as a code editor but as a modular synthesizer and sequencer. The goal is to build a "techno machine" in code that you can play and improvise with. We embrace minimalismâ€”the power comes from the interaction of a few well-chosen patterns, not from excessive complexity.

### Learning Outcomes
Upon completion, students will be able to:
- Create complex polyrhythmic patterns using Euclidean rhythms and pattern transformations
- Design professional-quality synthesized sounds using Strudel's synthesis engine
- Apply effects creatively as rhythmic and textural instruments
- Structure complete techno tracks with tension, release, and hypnotic flow
- Perform live using code as an instrument

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of electronic music structure
- Familiarity with programming concepts (variables, functions)
- Access to Strudel REPL (strudel.cc)
- Quality headphones or studio monitors

### Target Aesthetic
Professional hypnotic minimal techno in the style of:
- **Detroit Pioneers**: Jeff Mills, Robert Hood, Underground Resistance
- **UK Techno**: Surgeon, Luke Slater, James Ruskin
- **Hypnotic Minimalism**: Donato Dozzy, Rrose, Shifted
- **Modern Masters**: Oscar Mulero, Abdulla Rashim, Developer
