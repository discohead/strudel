# CLAUDE.md - Strudel Techno Curriculum

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive, ever-expanding curriculum for teaching hypnotic minimal techno composition using Strudel. The project is designed as a living document that can grow infinitely with new modules, techniques, and discoveries in techno production and live coding.

## Core Philosophy

- **Practical Over Theoretical**: Every concept must produce immediate musical results
- **Hypnotic Minimal Techno**: Focus on the aesthetic of Mills, Hood, Dozzy, Surgeon
- **Progressive Mastery**: Each module builds on previous knowledge
- **Never-Ending Journey**: The curriculum expands as techno and live coding evolve

## Current Structure

### Core Modules (1-10) - COMPLETE
1. **The Foundation** - Kick drum mastery
2. **The Groove Engine** - Hi-hats and Euclidean rhythms
3. **Hypnotic Tension** - Polyrhythms and percussion
4. **The Low End Theory** - Bassline composition
5. **Sonic Identity** - Advanced synthesis
6. **The Hook** - Probabilistic patterns
7. **Space & Dub** - Effects as instruments
8. **Structure & Arrangement** - Complete tracks
9. **Texture & Soul** - Sample integration
10. **The Live Coder** - Performance techniques

### Expansion Modules (11+) - IN PROGRESS
- Module 11: Modular Thinking - Interconnected pattern systems [COMPLETE]
- Module 12: The Acid Module - 303 emulation mastery
- Module 13: Industrial Techno - Noise and distortion
- Module 14: Ambient Techno - Beatless and atmospheric
- Module 15: Hardware Integration - MIDI/OSC with gear
- Module 16: Visual Techno - Synchronized visuals
- Module 17: AI Collaboration - Using ML for pattern generation
- Module 18: Networked Performance - Collaborative live coding
- Module 19: Techno Theory - Musical analysis
- Module 20: Production Pipeline - From Strudel to DAW

## Working with This Project

### Adding New Modules
```javascript
// Module template structure
- Learning objectives (5 specific skills)
- Core concepts with code examples
- Practical exercises (minimum 3)
- Style studies (analyze 2-3 artists)
- Assessment criteria
- Module assignment
```

### Refining Existing Modules
When improving modules, focus on:
1. Adding more artist-specific examples
2. Expanding exercise variations
3. Including student feedback solutions
4. Adding performance videos/recordings
5. Creating module-specific sample packs

### Code Style Guidelines
```javascript
// Always provide working examples
stack(
  sound("bd*4").gain(0.9),  // Clear comments
  bass.gain(0.7),           // Descriptive names
  hats.gain(0.4)            // Techno-appropriate levels
).cpm(130)  // Always include tempo
```

## Expansion Ideas

### Technical Expansions
- WebGL visualizations for each pattern
- Browser-based recording/streaming setup
- Pattern sharing system
- Student progress tracking
- Interactive exercises with validation

### Musical Expansions
- Regional techno styles (Detroit, Berlin, Birmingham, Tokyo)
- Hybrid genres (techno-jazz, techno-dub, industrial)
- Historical recreations (classic tracks in Strudel)
- Collaborative pattern libraries
- Guest artist modules

### Pedagogical Expansions
- Video tutorials for each module
- Live coding challenges/competitions
- Student showcase events
- Peer review system
- Certification pathway

## Development Workflow

### Creating New Content
1. Research specific techno subgenre/technique
2. Prototype patterns in Strudel
3. Test with target BPM range (120-140)
4. Verify code works in clean environment
5. Add progressive complexity
6. Include common problems/solutions

### Quality Checks
- All code must run without errors
- Patterns must sound professional
- Examples should be under 20 lines
- Comments explain "why" not "what"
- Each module builds on previous knowledge

## Technical Specifications

### Strudel Version Compatibility
- Developed for Strudel v1.0+
- Uses core packages: @strudel/core, @strudel/mini, @strudel/webaudio
- Compatible with Chrome/Firefox latest

### Audio Requirements
- 44.1kHz sample rate
- Low latency audio (<10ms)
- Stereo output minimum
- Headphones recommended for production

## Future Vision

This curriculum aims to become:
1. **The definitive techno live coding resource**
2. **A bridge between coding and club culture**
3. **A community of techno live coders**
4. **A research platform for new techniques**
5. **An ever-expanding musical universe**

## Contribution Guidelines

### For New Modules
- Follow existing module structure
- Include at least 10 code examples
- Reference real artists/tracks
- Test all code extensively
- Add to the module index

### For Improvements
- Preserve original intent
- Add rather than replace
- Document changes
- Test backwards compatibility
- Update relevant indices

## Remember

"Techno is a feeling, not a formula. This curriculum provides the tools, but the soul comes from you."

Keep it hypnotic. Keep it minimal. Keep it techno.
